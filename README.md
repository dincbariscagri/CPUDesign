# CPUDesign

As a project of Computer Architecture course, we designed an 8-bit CPU capable of array computation, text editing, signed multiplication and division. We selected multi-cycle work flow for our instructions. ISA design is made based on benchmarks provided to us. Design metrics, performance of CPU can be found in this report with full design codes, diagrams and tables. This design implemented on Cyclone II FPGA on the board of Terasicâ€™s DE2-70 board. Design software used is Quartus II v13.0.
